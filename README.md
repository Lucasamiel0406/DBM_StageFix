<h1> DBM Stage Fix</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2> After many people complaining about Stage commands crashing their bot and they also not removing Join/Leave/Move events from their Event Tab, I edited the join/leave events mod and now they avoid Stage Channels at all cost.</h2>
To download them, click on "Releases" and install them to your bot Events folder. And if you want to compare the edit with the original version you can take a look in this repo:

[DBM Mods - Events](https://github.com/dbm-network/mods/tree/master/events)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Note: They're unstable, only use them if you're part of the "I can't remove them and I need a fix or update right now"tards, and I won't give you any help for errors from both events, up to you and you should wait for official DJS and DBM updates.
